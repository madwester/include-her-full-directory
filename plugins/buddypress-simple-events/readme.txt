A simple Events plugin for BuddyPress

== Description ==

This BuddyPress plugin allows members to create, edit and delete Events from their profile.

It:

* provides a tab on each members' profile for front-end creation, editing and deletion
* uses the Google Places API for creating locations
* uses Google Maps to show Event location 
* creates a custom post type called 'event'
* uses WP and BP templates that can be overloaded
* includes a widget


It does NOT have:

* ticketing
* calendars - BUT should work with any WP Calendar that supports custom post types
* recurring events

If you would like support for...

* search
* a map showing all Events
* a Settings screen for Map options
* an end Date
* Images
* an Attending button
* an option for assignment to a Group

= Do I need a Google Maps API Key?
Yes. If you need help, read this tutorial [Google Maps API Key](https://www.philopress.com/google-maps-api-key/ "Google Maps API Key")

= MultiSite support? =

Yes. Tested in the following configuration:

* WP.4.1.1 - Multisite
